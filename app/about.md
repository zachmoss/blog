This is my personal blog where I mostly attempt to write weeknotes. Sometimes I'll write a post about something specific, in a bit more depth. It's not to be confused with my [allotment blog](https://zachmoss.github.io/allotmentnotes/).

I started weeknotes in 2022 after going to a workshop by [Giles Turnbull](https://gilest.org/about/index.html). He's written this [helpful guide about weeknotes](https://gilest.org/doingweeknotes/) if you're wondering what they are.

For me, it's a place to document some thoughts. Mostly about work, but also some personal stuff. All it is really ([as Giles says](https://gilest.org/notes/blog-brain.html))

> A blog is your brain, over time... on the internet

## Work
I work at [Compassion in Dying](https://compassionindying.org.uk/). Have done for over 10 years… wowzers.

It's in the field of death and dying, which can be difficult at times but it is fulfilling. Let's just say it provides some healthy (and unhealthy) perspective.

I'm kind of a digital person, but in many ways a generalist. I work at a small charity, so by necessity (but also curiosity) I dabble in content design, user research, interaction design, technical stuff and more.

## This website
Most of the code for this website was ~~stolen~~ copied from [Frankie Roberto](https://github.com/frankieroberto). Thanks to him. And to the talented people at GOV.UK who put together [this handy website](https://govuk-eleventy-plugin.x-govuk.org/).
