We’ve had some external help to think through how we update our advance decision form.

Our previous update cycles were too long, and we’ve suffered from a bit of *inertia* when it comes to making changes to our form.

Caroline Jarret (a forms expert) has given us some ideas and tips for a better approach...

We’ve designed a new process, which:

- is realistic about what we can do given our team size and other priorities
- doesn’t let big problems delay making small changes
- thinks about the form as one thing (not online and paper)
- can be embedded as a new core piece of work we do

## The new process...

We will collect feedback and information relevant to advance decisions regularly and will log a problem or proposed change card in Trello. 

To help us develop the advance decision we will draw from many sources (not an exhaustive list):
 
Internal
- Enquires to the information line service
- Feedback from the information line team
- Stage two monitoring feedback
- Online service feedback
 
External  
- Desktop research
- SME research and publications
- Court of Protection cases
- Stakeholder policy/service updates (OPG etc)
