description: I'm officially an allotment owner... after 7 years waiting.
---

7 years, 8 months, and 2 days ago I put my name down for an allotment at [Ally Pally Allotments](https://free-4270825.webador.co.uk/).

I was 130 on the list... and was told a likely wait of 8 - 10 years for a plot.

At the time I was in the middle of moving into a new flat in Hornsey, just near the bottom of Ally Pally. With no real inkling of where I'd be in 8 years time.

Well it turns out that 5 house moves later, I'd be moving into a flat 5 minutes walk from the allotments... funny how life works!

## Choosing a plot
Once I'd reached the top of the list I was shown a few plots by the site secretary. I felt a little under pressure to get it right and after seeing a few plots which were overgrown, or near the road decided to wait until a better one came available. I'd waited nearly 8 years for a plot so thought I might as well start with one I felt good with.

I remember when first looking at a few plots feeling:

- nervous about choosing the wrong one
- a bit daunted about starting an allotment after such a long wait
- very lucky to have the chance
- excited to begin what could be a new fulfilling hobby

Just a few months later, I was shown a couple more and settled on a nice one up near the top of the site.

## Number 30 Grove Lodge Meadow

So... this is it!

It's a half-plot I think, 5 poles which is about 125 square metres. What's especially nice about this plot is that it's up near the top end - which I believe is the Grove Lodge Meadow bit. This means I can come in via the top gate which is literally less than 5 minutes walk from my flat. What luck.

A nice, well tended plot. With crab apple trees, raspberries and a shed.

## The plan (if there is one)

I'm trying to not put too much pressure on getting everything right. I have to fight the urge to try and do everything *properly* from day one. From what I've read and heard, mistakes are to be made and learnt from.

Chatting to one of the other allotment owners before a talk, she suggested starting small which I like.

My current thinking is to:

1. Build a few raised beds for new vegetables (tbd which ones)
2. Start a [no-dig bed](https://charlesdowding.co.uk/blogs/no-dig-resources/beginners-guide)
2. Establish an area for composting
3. Learn what already grows well
4. Maybe finish the pond which had been started by the previous tenant

I've already seen how the endless possibilities can paralyse decision making so I'm keen to start small.

I also want to embrace the thinking this is for the long-term.

I'm very much looking forward to just starting. Getting to know and learn from fellow travellers at the allotments, and just generally enjoying the journey.

## This blog

I intend to use this blog as a way of documenting the journey, and some of the lessons learnt along the way.

I'll see if the [weeknote method](https://gilest.org/doingweeknotes/) works, but again - not putting too much pressure on it.
