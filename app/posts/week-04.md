Scrambled eggs with crab — 6/10 (too rich, feel a bit sick)

* A quietish week. But the main thing was seeing our first ‘design exploration’ of what [our new website](https://medium.com/death-dying-and-digital/our-approach-to-building-a-better-website-40a1bbb992ab) might look like. I can’t show any screenshots which is a shame as the new website is coinciding with launching a whole new brand. But it’s looking good.
* As I was looking over a few of the designs I was thinking about where the line is between:

1️⃣ Clear, simple design (think NHS and GOV.UK)

2️⃣ Design which is much more visually distinct (maybe something like [Farewill](https://farewill.com/))

* I’m not sure where I stand, but we’ve had a [beta website](https://beta.compassionindying.org.uk/) live for a while now where real users have been giving feedback and there is a split between those who have positive things to say about something like this:

People have said things like:

> I found the old site clunky to navigate and signpost to relevant documents. This is much easier to navigate and find what you need.

But people have also said:

> It’s a horrid format. De-personalised government feel.

Ouch.

* I think I prefer simplicity and something which means users completing tasks and consume information as easily as possible. I think we’ll end up somewhere in between… either way the designs I saw this week make me think we’ll land in the right spot.
* In other more important news I finally stumped up the £12.99 required to become a premium member of [BorrowMyDoggy](https://www.borrowmydoggy.com/about). In case you’ve not heard, _it connects dog owners with trusted local people who would love to look after their dog_. Long story short, walked my first dog called Reilly:
