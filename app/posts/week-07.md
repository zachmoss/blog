Didn’t have a breakfast worth a photo, so here’s a nice snowy shot from the top of Ally Pally.

* My memory failed me a bit trying to think back over this past year (what a blur 2022 has felt like). So I started thinking of where I was this time last year…
* I’d left my job at Unison, having only lasted a few months — and returned to my old job. I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/%5Fzachmoss/status/1478400885340491780) about how I felt at the time. Never got round to writing the blog about the experience which is a shame. But reflecting on it one year on I am thankful to be in a job I love with great people, in a sector I know and find interesting. I am still very grateful for being given the opportunity to come back (a boomerang 🪃).
* In January, we’ll launch a new website and a new brand. Lots of work has gone into it this year, so will be glad to see it out in the open. Watch this space…
* I was asked to be a godfather recently by some very close friends. Which is lovely (and scary).
* I’ve had family stuff to deal with this year which has been (and continues to be) quite stressful and thought provoking. A natural part of aging I guess. I’ve thought a lot about the concept of [filial duty](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3015170/).
* I started going to the gym for the first time ever to work on my chronic back pain this year. Never thought I’d say that. Doing proper weights. Not sure it’s massively helped, but at least I’m trying.
* Seen lots of movies, swam a lot and kept playing squash. All things I love and will continue doing in 2023 I hope.
* Lots of nice holidays. Lake District probably the standout (I think maybe it always is).
* A [strange end to the year](https://medium.com/@%5Fzachmoss/week-6-63294f62ee7e). Had my first ever proper health scare. Still waiting for some results, but I am very relieved to have not had some potentially very bad news after a colonoscopy.
* I am now thinking a lot about how (if) you move on from something like this. I’m currently thinking I’ll try and change my diet quite significantly next year. As someone who loves food I’m slightly unsure how to approach this…
* My parting thought of 2022\. It is an overused cliche, but working where I work you realise it is one which has substance. If you were to find out tomorrow you had a life-changing diagnosis, how would you reflect on your life, your decisions? It’s funny how much I use this to guide decisions I make. I’ll probably start doing this even more next year. The clock is ticking after all.

**p.s.** I started weeknotes. I like it. I will carry on.
