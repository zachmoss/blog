Eggs with ‘[Coffee Sriracha](https://catalyst.cafe/products/coffee-sriracha)’ hollandaise at Catalyst Cafe — 7.5/10

* Past few weeks has been pretty full-on getting our new website near to ready for launch. I’m reminded of a thought I generally have with websites. They are beasts of a project, thousands of decisions to be made — every one constrained and led by designers, developers, stakeholders.
* I must admit, looking forward to having a live website and re-focusing on content and services. The nitty gritty of helping people navigate difficult moments in their lives. The website is just a thing to enable us to do that.
* It’s hard to ignore the news about the NHS. This [tragic story](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-64243044) in particular of a man who died of a heart attack as a result of ambulance delays is truly awful. Just imagine going through this?
* At the moment it feels like a real moment for the NHS in this country. It feels like a serious failure that we’re in this position. So bad that it’s hard to constructively think how to fix it. I do not envy those whose responsibility it is.
