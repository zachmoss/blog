No breakfast so here are some [chocolate chip cookies](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021435-perfect-chocolate-chip-cookies) I baked…

* Getting very close to the new website launch. Felt like I kind of broke the back of the project this week. A good feeling.
* The new site will in large part eliminate PDFs. Loads of chat over the years about this, mostly on Twitter — [here](https://twitter.com/jamestplunkett/status/1494669060759506947) from James and [here](https://twitter.com/mr%5Fdudders/status/1356594043036262413) from FullFact. It will mean that now our research reports will be available as HTML pages.
* This seems like a technical / accessibility thing yes — but actually I’m also getting quite excited now about what this might mean for us as an organisation. As this article says —[ “_The solutions to all our problems may be buried in PDFs that nobody reads_”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/05/08/the-solutions-to-all-our-problems-may-be-buried-in-pdfs-that-nobody-reads/?noredirect=on).
* Have quite a lot of usability testing to do on the new site before launching. It’s bad how far away from users you can feel during the build phase of a website project…
* To victoryyyyyy
