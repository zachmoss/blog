No breakfast, but here is a delicious pre-lunch snack I ate at [The Sportsman](http://www.thesportsmanseasalter.co.uk/)

* Prompted to pickup these weeknotes again after being kindly reminded that some people are in fact reading them!
* One thought I had this week is how important car parks are. Not actual car parks, but the figurative ‘_do it later_’ car park. With the new website I’m launching next week — I have a ‘car park’ full of things to work on post-launch. A list of things not quite critical for launch, but important enough not to drop. I like it as a framework for prioritisation because it fits with my ‘_do less, but better_’ mantra. Reduce the breadth of things you work on to increase the quality of outputs. My list is looking like a multi-storey car park at the moment so will need to have a proper think about prioritisation over the next few weeks…
* I had one of those moments this week where the boundary between work and personal was blurred. It’s happened at various points working here over as number of years but this time it was in a nice way. I had a meeting at my synagogue to discuss how they might get involved in the work of both [Dignity in Dying](https://www.dignityindying.org.uk/) and [Compassion in Dying](https://compassionindying.org.uk/). I was sat in a meeting with a colleague, the Rabbi who performed the ceremony at my brothers Bar Mitzvah, and some close friends of my parents who I’ve known for years. It was a bit surreal, but lovely.
* Some exciting news this week that a [fancy new restaurant](https://www.hot-dinners.com/2023021512130/Gastroblog/Latest-news/marksman-lasdun-national-theatre-south-bank-london-restaurant) is opening at the National Theatre. Regular visitors will know the South Bank is a bit of a foodie blackspot so this is great news.
* Long awaited new website to be launched next Wednesday (22nd Feb) — [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/%5Fzachmoss) if you want to see what all the fuss is about.
* Oh and because I love big projects, we’ll be kicking off a huge digital project in the next few weeks too. A very, very exciting project.
* I will be in Paris this time next week, so if all goes to plan expect photos of some sensational pastry…
