* Finally, we [launched our new website](http://www.compassionindying.org.uk/). Pleased with the response, but mostly just pleased we can now get working on some new content and other important bits of work. As [I said before](https://twitter.com/%5Fzachmoss/status/1628363377671118848), what the new website gives us is the infrastructure and design language to really take advantage of our expertise (for the benefit of our users).
* I went to Paris. Absolutely loved it for a variety of reasons. One of _the_ great cities of the world. Also my first time on the Eurostar (it’s as good as people say).

* This week we kicked off a piece of work with [Hippo Digital](https://hippodigital.co.uk/). We’re re-building our [online advance decision / advance statement service](https://mydecisions.org.uk/). We have very bold ambitions for this service and it touches on many strands of work — influencing medical culture and practice, content design, user research, NHS tech, digital exclusion and much more. Stay tuned — this’ll be a good one to follow.
