No fancy breakfast, so some early spring bulbs…

* Had a ‘bitty’ week so no huge work updates, but…
* We saw a first prototype of our advance decision service using GOV.UK design system components which was quite fun. Hippo want to validate some of the pain points in the [existing service](https://mydecisions.org.uk/) but at the same time see how it might function using a well known and tested design system. We should have some results next week.
* Believe it or not, I’ve still yet to receive my biopsy results of the [colonoscopy I had in December last year](https://medium.com/@%5Fzachmoss/week-6-63294f62ee7e). Officially that is…
* I’ve been ringing and chasing these for months with absolutely no luck. So I decided to go via PALS, and also submit a [subject access request](https://www.whittington.nhs.uk/?c=14849) of my hospital records. It took 2 weeks to get a response. I was sent a PDF document of all my records held on file. Lo and behold, right at the end were my biopsy results. I _think_ what it shows is that all is normal. I only say think, because there is a lot of medical jargon. But unless I’ve grossly misinterpreted them — then I’m happy.
* Frustratingly, the actual lab results date back to 7 January. So in theory I could’ve seen these months ago. What I’m waiting for is a consultant to read these, and write me a letter to explain the results and what this means. So I’m still in essence waiting.
* Even though my main worry of cancer was in a way ruled out on the day of the procedure, not knowing for sure has been frustrating. I want to know what they found, I want it explained so I can understand so I can move on. I still don’t know for example if I need any sort of follow-up or ‘surveillance’ of my bowel going forward? Yes, the NHS is at breaking point. Maybe it is irreparably broken. But it doesn’t change the need to communicate effectively, and promptly to allay peoples worries and fears…
* The wait goes on…
