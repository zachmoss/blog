Kagianas at Catalyst Cafe — 7/10

* It’s been two months since the [last weeknote](/posts/week-15/). Waaay too long. But in my defence it’s because we’ve been flat out finishing up our service for launch. It’s now been pushed live.
* It’s a weird feeling, after so much work and lots of stress. Also for a few reasons we’ve decided to ‘soft-launch’… every so quietly to see how it operates live. We’ll slowly ramp up traffic to it over the next few weeks.
* It feels a bit anti-climactic. But as Chris (one of the Hippo devs) said to me, we’ve done what we set out to achieve which was to re-build our online advance decision service with improvements. We’ve moved supplier and I’m confident we have a great service to build upon for the future.
* Time to pause, reflect and take stock. I am extremely conscious to document the thousands of decisions and notes that come with big build projects like these so we lose none of the knowledge. That’s why it’s important to work out loud people. Document your thinking over time. A lesson in how hard it is to do well — especially when you’re in the thick of it.
* I also want to run a retro process of some sort to figure out what we could’ve done better — so we can learn something practical when we next do something this big.
