I went on holiday to Bologna and had a ludicrously good gelato — 10/10.

* I went on holiday and came back to news our [new online service](https://www.advancedecision.service.compassionindying.org.uk/) is just… working. So that’s nice.
* Now we’re starting to think about how we can start sharing this work with others.
* To rewind briefly, our new service helps people complete [advance decision](https://compassionindying.org.uk/how-we-can-help/living-will-advance-decision/) and [advance statement](https://compassionindying.org.uk/how-we-can-help/advance-statement/) forms. It is a **VERY** messy policy space. Unlike lasting power of attorney (LPA), the Government has not taken on service provision. This is despite the them being governed by the same law — the [Mental Capacity Act](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/making-decisions-for-someone-else/mental-capacity-act/). This means the provision of advance decisions has been left to the private sector, charities like us, solicitors etc…
* So there’s a gap in provision which has led to fragmentation, inconsistency and a proliferation of different forms. We’re trying to fix this.
* We think we have the best service available to help people complete advance decisions and advance statements. That’s why we’ve invested significant effort to build our new service in a way which makes it easy to replicate. That;s why we’ve built it using the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/). We want this service to be that good, that it discourages others trying to re-invent the wheel.
* If an NHS organisation wants to provide their own advance decision service — our service is here for them. We’ve done the hard work to make that possible.
* We’re currently thinking through this proposition. How we talk about it, how we ‘sell’ it, and how we convince people or organisations that our service is the best — and that they should either use it, or signpost to us.
* We’re really interested in how you do this well, how do you build a community around this? Is it a software development, Github led way of open sourcing code? Or is it something else?
* I am struck by how hard this might be to do well… and slightly daunted.
