* Last week I said we’re doing some thinking about [how best to share](/posts/week-17/) our new [online advance decision service](https://www.advancedecision.service.compassionindying.org.uk/). I was racking my brain of who I could talk to, and thought I’d finally say hello and ask [Juksie](https://twitter.com/jukesie). One of those Twitter personalities I’ve followed for literally years without ever meeting.
* He was (as I’d hoped) hugely helpful and generous with his time. We had a very useful chat about ‘open source’ as an approach. Why that might not be the right framing for what we’re trying to do, and how the phrase has some baggage. Great insight.
* Also helpful to get a real sense of how much work it is (a lot), and how important it is to have a ‘support wrapper’ to our offer. Yes we’ve built something that will largely be a self-service way to use our code — but organisations may still need ways to direct support queries if they can’t deal with them in house.
* Matt also highlighted a few interesting use cases which I’ll be looking into to see if there is something we can learn from — [Delib Citizen Space](https://www.delib.net/citizen%5Fspace) and [LocalGov Drupal](https://localgovdrupal.org/).
* I was also doing a big of digging into the (now defunct) [GOV.UK performance platform](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/tag/performance-platform/). I want to set something up similar for our service so am looking into how we might get some help with that…
* I ended the week [observing another case](https://twitter.com/KitzingerCelia/status/1693971290997088516) about withdrawal of treatment at the Court of Protection. I may do a proper write-up about the case, but it was another fascinating insight into this court. The case was a painful dilemma about a religious preacher in coma. Hospital believes treatment is no longer in his best interests but the family say he would want ongoing treatment.
* For anyone interested in medical ethics, law and medicine —these cases are moving, compelling and I think should be required viewing for medical professionals. I would recommend following the [Open Justice Court of Protection Project](https://openjusticecourtofprotection.org/) who have guidance on how to observe cases (anyone can).
