🇹🇭 Thai mango. Hand delivered by my parents after a trip to Thailand 🥭

* I’m moving house. Moving is not fun.
* Thai mangoes are the best in the world. No question. I will not be taking questions on this matter.
* Last weeknote [talked about observing a case at the Court of Protection](https://medium.com/@%5Fzachmoss/week-18-fbc25d7f188e). Since then we’ve done a bit of digging and think that we need to find out a bit more about mediation.
* We want to find out how mediation might play a role for people in the lead up to taking a case at the Court of Protection.
* Someone who needs help fighting for the best interests of someone close to them might need several options of support — think tech support… first line, second line etc…
* When things go wrong, there needs to be recourse for them to raise issues. We can help, but what about when the relationship with their healthcare team breaks down? Mediation might help here, BEFORE it gets into legal territory.
* We’ve identified some players in this field we want to speak to as part of this look into best interests decision making. Rather helpfully I stumbled across this interesting piece of research looking into [mediating conflict between families and doctors](https://essexlawresearch.uk/2022/08/11/mediating-conflict-between-families-and-doctors/).
