So we finally launched our [content on best interests decisions](https://compassionindying.org.uk/how-we-can-help/making-decision-someone-else/). Months of research, writing and iterating. Probably our biggest exploration on any content topic because it spans such a wide range of sub-topics and laws. I'm particularly please with our use of the [step-by-step pattern](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/step-by-step-navigation/) from the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) to frame help people figure out [what to do if someone’s wishes are not being respected](https://compassionindying.org.uk/how-we-can-help/making-decision-someone-else/#what-to-do-if-someones-wishes-are-not-being-respected).

Always a sense of relief when you finally publish - now we want to drive users to the page to really stress test it. Seeing how it interacts with our other content too is important - as with our topics they can very easily blur into one for people. As simple and clear as we try to make our content - these are hard things to grasp. 

## A tale of two meetings
Had two meetings this week which couldn't have been more different. One was an exploratory meeting with [Caroline Jarrett](https://www.effortmark.co.uk/) whose work I've followed and admired for years. I've said for a while if we ever start thinking about how to research and work on our advance decision form - she is the person to talk to. It didn't disappoint, she was great and we even found out she'd written a blog on living will (advance directives) years ago. It felt a little bit like the professional/work stars had aligned. Anyway, she was interested in the topic (not always a given with us) and I do hope we'll figure out a way to work with her. The other meeting was frustrating and I won't go into details other than it's one of those where we heard about something that we probably should've earlier. Where decisions had already been made. Safe to say it was a very different experience to the Monday meeting. I'm still trying to unpick what it means.

It reminded me of a quote I saw in a [blog post](https://demotive.com/posts/2024/03/15/weeknotes-week-ending-15-march-2024/) in the past few weeks. The [original quote](https://benholliday.com/2023/11/28/hold-it-lightly/) is from Ben Holliday:

> “Being pragmatic (you can’t achieve everything today), while still being optimistic (the bigger picture is still worth caring deeply about).”

## Other things
Some other fun things which happened...
* A lovely lunch where my parents met my partners parents for the first time. A bit nervous about how it'd go (not for the normal reasons) but it was great. Turns out good home-cooked thai food and sun helps.
* I turned 36. I never make much of birthdays, but I had several lovely meals out. A burger which realllly hit the spot (haven't had one in a very long time which I think helps) and a classy one at the [Garden Café](https://gardenmuseum.org.uk/cafe/). A bit of a hidden secret, lovely food and lovely venue. Lots of glass and plants.
* I saw [Portrait of a Lady on Fire](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8613070/) at the [BFI Stephen Street](https://www.bfi.org.uk/venue-hire/hiring-bfi-stephen-street) screening rooms. An old film which I didn't catch when it came out in 2019 but wow. Right up there for me as an LGBT love story. Captivating, smart, steamy and beautifully shot - an absolute triumph. The venue was also very cool, felt like a little secret screening - tip here for seats is that it's one of those rare screens where actually sitting closer is better I think.
